To register, we require you to share your device ID and device model in exchange of our generated ID, which will be used for contact tracing. We also ask that you give permissions in Bluetooth and location access. We use Bluetooth to collect records of users in proximity. These records include Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and transmitted power (txPower) of your Bluetooth, the generated ID of you and your contact, and the time of contact. We DO NOT collect your location coordinates. We only use location access to ensure Bluetooth communications work. You can always OPT-OUT from creating these records by disabling contact tracing in-app. The records will be used to determine who are your close contacts to whom we'll notify their exposure. They are kept for only 3 weeks. 

You may also voluntarily declare in-app of your lab test results by filling out the dates of testing and when the test result is received, and whether you're positive. The validity of your report is determined by scanning a QR code found in your test results. These QR codes are only found in laboratories we are coordinating with.

The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.
